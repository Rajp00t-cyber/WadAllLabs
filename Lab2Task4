    <b><h1>Seasons</h1></b>

    <b><h2>Spring</h2></b>
    <p>
        Spring is a season of renewal and awakening, where the world shakes off the cold slumber of winter and bursts into vibrant life. 
        Trees regain their leaves in a bright palette of greens, flowers bloom in colorful waves, and the air is filled with the gentle hum of bees and the sweet scent of blossoms. 
        It’s a time when days grow longer, the sun shines warmer, and nature puts on its most stunning display, inviting everyone outside to breathe deeply and take it all in.
        <br>
        There’s a certain magic to spring that stirs both the earth and the spirit. Gardens come alive with tulips, daffodils, and cherry blossoms, while birds return from their migrations to fill the skies with song. 
        The season seems to offer a fresh start — not just in nature, but in our lives too. Whether it’s planting seeds in the soil or setting new intentions for the months ahead, spring encourages growth, hope, and possibility.

        Beyond its natural beauty, spring brings a sense of joy and energy that’s hard to resist. Outdoor cafes reopen, festivals and farmers markets buzz with activity, and evening walks become a daily pleasure. 
        It’s a season that pulls people together, not just because of the warmth, but because everything feels a little more alive, a little more possible. 
        Spring doesn’t just change the world around us — it changes how we feel within it.

    <b><h2>Summer</h2></b>
    <p>
        Summer is a season of sunshine, freedom, and unforgettable moments. The days stretch long and golden, inviting adventures from dawn to dusk. 
        Whether it's the sound of waves crashing on a beach, the laughter of children playing outside, or the scent of sunscreen and barbecue in the air, summer creates a vibrant atmosphere that feels like pure joy. 
        It’s the perfect time to escape routine and dive into the warmth of life’s simple pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nature flourishes in summer — trees are full and lush, flowers bloom brightly, and the sky seems endlessly blue. 
        It’s a time for barefoot walks on warm grass, for swimming in cool lakes, and for chasing fireflies as the sun dips below the horizon. 
        The world feels more alive, more colorful, and every moment seems to hold the promise of fun. 
        From spontaneous road trips to quiet moments under a starry sky, summer offers memories that linger long after the season ends.
    </p>
    <p>
        But beyond the fun and freedom, summer also brings a sense of connection. It’s a season of togetherness — of family picnics, late-night talks, and shared laughter under open skies. 
        There’s a special kind of magic in the way summer brings people closer, encouraging everyone to slow down and savor the moment. 
        In the warmth of summer, life feels fuller, brighter, and more open to all the beauty the world has to offer.
